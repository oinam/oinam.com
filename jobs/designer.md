I’m helping a few friends’ companies to hire some fantastic **Designers**.

We’re looking for Designers who have built digital products with a deep focus on designing and crafting user experiences that make customers love. You are keen to solve real user problems through design backed with research, data, and empathy. You should have a strong portfolio with live projects on the web and a keen eye for detail regarding usability, accessibility, and interaction design.

This is a hands-on role where you’ll lead design initiatives from discovery through delivery, partnering closely with cross-functional teams to bring intuitive digital experiences to life.

## Key Responsibilities

- Lead end-to-end design processes—from user research and wireframes to high-fidelity UI and interactive prototypes.
- Deliver user-centric designs that improve usability, engagement, and performance across mobile and web platforms.
- Conduct usability testing, synthesize feedback, and iterate based on insights and product metrics.
- Maintain and evolve our design system to ensure visual and interaction consistency across all products.
- Collaborate closely with developers to ensure smooth implementation and high-quality outcomes.
- Present your work and articulate design decisions clearly to stakeholders and team members.

## Requirements

- 5+ years of experience in Product Design, UX/UI Design, or a related role.
- A strong portfolio showcasing high-quality mobile and web design work, with some live examples available online.
- Deep proficiency in modern design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or similar.
- Strong communication, collaboration, decent writing skill, and problem-solving skills.
- Ability to align user needs with business goals and technical constraints.

## Plus

- A working knowledge of front-end technologies (HTML and CSS) to communicate effectively with developers. If you can understand JavaScript frameworks/templates to tinker with the HTML and CSS part of it, it will definitely send the developer over the edge. We‘d love that. 
- Experience with user research techniques, A/B testing, and usability studies.
- Familiarity with motion design or creating delightful micro-interactions.
- Knowledge of accessibility standards and best practices.
